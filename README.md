## Introduction
This project performs a detailed analysis of the COVID-19 dataset to understand the spread and impact of the virus globally. It answers several key questions and provides visualizations to help interpret the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about the COVID-19 pandemic, including the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for different regions around the world.

## Requirements
To run the analysis, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- IPython

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib ipython

Analysis
Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered Cases by Region
This section aggregates the number of confirmed, death, and recovered cases by region and displays the top 20 regions.

Data Filtering
Records with confirmed cases less than 10 are removed for more meaningful analysis.

Maximum and Minimum Cases by Region
Identifies the regions with the maximum confirmed cases and the minimum deaths.

India Specific Data
Shows the COVID-19 cases reported in India up to April 29, 2020.

Sorting Data
Confirmed Cases: Sorts the entire dataset by confirmed cases in ascending order.
Recovered Cases: Sorts the entire dataset by recovered cases in descending order.
Visualizations
Various visualizations are included to better understand the data, such as heatmaps for null values and bar charts for cases by region.
